# Asset meta files stored in the same folder as their assets.
# This ensures that meta files are handled consistently by Git.
#
# It is important to remember that meta files are required for Unity to track
# assets. They contain crucial information like GUIDs and import settings.
# Generally, you *should* commit meta files alongside their corresponding assets.
# This section is commented out to reflect the common practice of committing
# .meta files. Uncomment specific lines if you have a strong reason to ignore
# them (e.g., auto-generated meta files for external tools that are
# regenerated often and don't contain critical data).

# Assets and Scenes
# ==============================================================================
# For scenes and prefabs, it's recommended to force text serialization in Unity
# (Edit > Project Settings > Editor > Asset Serialization > Mode: Force Text).
# This makes diffs human-readable and merges easier.
# Forcing text serialization for .unity and .prefab files is typically done
# via .gitattributes, not .gitignore.

# ==============================================================================
# Packages
# ==============================================================================
# When using Unity Package Manager, 'Packages/manifest.json' and 'Packages/packages-lock.json'
# should generally be committed to source control to track dependencies.
# Uncomment if you want to ignore them for specific reasons.
